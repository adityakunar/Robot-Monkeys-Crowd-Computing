In this repository we have 4 main folders-:

1) Datasets => This folder contains the ground truth datasets that we used to generate the HITs for our different task designs.

2) Processed Datasets => This folder contains the dataset csv files that were used to actually fill in the forms for the various task designs on MTurk Sandbox.

3) Data Processing => This folder stores all our scripts used to generate the input csvs for our task designs and contains scripts that were used to process the outputs by workers for the pilot study as well as the final tasks. 

4) Task HTML => This folder contains all the different HTML scripts used to design our task designs for MTurk Sandbox.
